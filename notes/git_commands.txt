Create branches on local setup only, test changes on local branches.  Once happy merge changes onto local master and push to server master.

Initial setup:
#clone the repository to local machine
$ git clone hospita@hospitalpages.ie:/home/hospita/git/HospitalPages /path/to/where local repo will be

Creating new branch and updating remote master branch:
#create local branch based off master just cloned
$git branch mynewbranch

#switch to new branch, check branch status anytime using $git status
$git checkout mynewbranch

#make changes on the new branch when happy with changes commit to mynewbranc
# -a means add all changed files, -m is for commit message
$git commit -a -m "new changes"

#once all changes are made for a unit of work or a day, merge mynewbranch into master
#to do this first switch to master
$git checkout master

#then synch local master with remote master in case other users have added new content to the remote master
#if you get message "Already up to date" you'll have no potential conflicts
$git pull

#to do a test merge with no commits use, to see if it is what you expect do
$git merge --no-commit --no-ff mynewbranch

#now merge locally, your local branch with local master
$git merge mynewbranch

#do the real thing
$git merge mynewbranch

#resolve conflicts if there are any

#push local master to remote
$git push

NB: update working tree on server with $git reset --hard
